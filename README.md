# Robot Vehicle with Arm - Bluetooth Control via MIT App Inventor

## Overview

This project allows you to control a robotic vehicle equipped with a robotic arm using a mobile app built with **MIT App Inventor**. The system uses **Bluetooth communication** to send commands from the mobile device to a microcontroller on the vehicle.

It's ideal for learning about embedded systems, mobile interface development, and robotics.

## Features

* Control the movement of the vehicle (forward, backward, left, right, stop)
* Control the robotic arm (rotation, lifting, gripper open/close, etc.)
* Bluetooth connectivity (e.g. via HC-05/HC-06)
* Simple Android app interface built with MIT App Inventor

---

## Hardware Requirements

* Microcontroller (e.g. Arduino Uno, ESP32, etc.)
* Bluetooth module (HC-05 or HC-06)
* Mobile robot chassis (motors, wheels, etc.)
* Robotic arm with servos
* Power supply
* Smartphone (Android)

---

## Software Requirements

* Arduino IDE
* MIT App Inventor ([https://appinventor.mit.edu/](https://appinventor.mit.edu/))
* Bluetooth terminal (optional, for testing)

---

## Setup Instructions

1. Upload the Arduino code to the microcontroller.
2. Connect the Bluetooth module to the microcontroller (TX/RX + VCC/GND).
3. Install the mobile app built with MIT App Inventor on your Android device.
4. Pair the phone with the Bluetooth module.
5. Launch the app and connect to the module.
6. Use the app buttons to control the vehicle and the robotic arm.
